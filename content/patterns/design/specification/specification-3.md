## Specification design pattern

Criticisms (Anti-Pattern):

- Cargo Cult Programming - There lacks a well-defined purpose for this pattern, and there's no guide when to implement it or not
- Inner-platform effect - And() function which directly replicate &&
- Spaghetti/Lasagna Code - Separate classes for each part of the specification fragments what could be a cohesive object
