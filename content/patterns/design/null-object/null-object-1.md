## Null Object design pattern

> Null Object is an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral ("null") behavior

> In most object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#, references may be null. These references need to be checked to ensure they are not null before invoking any methods, because methods typically cannot be invoked on null references.
