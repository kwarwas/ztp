## Microservices

- Microservices are a more concrete and modern interpretation of service-oriented architectures (SOA) used to build distributed software systems. 
As in SOA, services in a microservice architecture (MSA) are processes that communicate with each other over a network in order to fulfill a goal.
Also, like in SOA, these services use technology-agnostic protocols. 

- Microservices' architectural style is a first realisation of SOA that has happened after the introduction of DevOps and this is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems
