## Message - Events

> An event signifies that something has happened. Events are published using a message consumer. An event should never be sent directly to an endpoint. Events should be expressed in a noun-verb (past tense) sequence, indicating that something happened.

Example Events:

- CustomerAddressUpdated
- CustomerAccountUpgraded
- OrderSubmitted, OrderAccepted
