## Side-effect

> In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state or has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world. For example, a function might modify a global or static variable, modify one of its arguments, raise an exception, write data to a display or file, read data, or call other side-effecting functions. In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters.
